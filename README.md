# MsPacman_DQN_Epsilon_Greedy
This project is an implementation of my own variant of Epsilon Greedy Deep Q-Networks, with the final model not being purely greedy, but also epsilon greedy, allowing the agent to escape spots that it is stuck in.

Trained on CPU, Built on PyTorch, with a top evaluation score of 3000+ points
